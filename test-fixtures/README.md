# Test Fixtures

This directory contains intentionally "dirty" code to demonstrate all vibeCheck tools.
These files trigger at least one issue per tool, which remain open as demo issues in this repo.

All findings from test-fixtures are labeled with `demo` and merged separately from real repository issues.

## Files and What They Test

| File                                          | Tool(s)                | Issues                                                        |

(\*) SpotBugs requires compiled .class files and won't produce findings without a Java build system.

## Notes

- **tsc**: TypeScript errors in test-fixtures are excluded from tsconfig.json to prevent build failures. Real tsc issues come from actual project code.
- **SpotBugs**: Requires compiled Java bytecode. Since we don't have a build system (Maven/Gradle), SpotBugs cannot analyze the demo Java files.
- **Demo separation**: All test-fixtures findings are prefixed with `demo|` in merge keys and labeled with `demo` to keep them separate from real repository issues.

## Running Analysis

```bash
# Run local preview (shows all findings as issue previews)
npx tsx tests/local-preview.ts

# Run analysis directly
npx tsx src/core/analyze.ts --root="."

# With severity filter
npx tsx src/core/analyze.ts --severity-threshold=high
```

## Demo Issues

When vibeCheck runs on this repo, it creates GitHub issues for each finding.
These issues serve as:

1. **Demos** - Show what vibeCheck-created issues look like
2. **Test targets** - AI agents can practice fixing them
3. **Documentation** - Each issue explains the problem and fix

Issues are labeled with `vibeCheck` and include:

- Severity and confidence ratings
- All affected file locations (merged)
- Agent instructions with branch naming
- Fingerprint for deduplication
